# Self-driving-car
A lane detection, vehicle detection and path finding algorithm 

The algorithm sits on top of an opencv-python computer vision cluster that is used to detect lanes and vehicles.

# Usage
Run the main.py file in your terminal. It will start to take frames/pictures of the top 320x240 window. It will start detecting edges and objects using Haar Cascades and Hough Lines.
